# VC_min_deg
code to discover reduction rules for VC on small-degree-graphs

# input file format (see example input file)
input files should be lists of pairs of vertex names, where names "A" -- "H" are interpreted as "border sets"

# output format (for debuglevel 0)
the output is 2 lines of header (including the profile of the input graph)
followed by a list of graphs with equivalent profile, one per line, with edges in format "(X,Y)"
